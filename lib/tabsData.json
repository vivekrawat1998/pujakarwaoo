          "About": "After the proper completion of the Samavartan Sanskar, the sequence of the Vivah Sanskar (marriage ceremony) follows, which is considered the most significant among all the sacraments. Only after marriage does one attain eligibility to enter the Grihastha Ashram (householder stage). According to Acharya Manu, one should marry at the age of 25 and duly follow the duties of a householder after marriage. The Grihastha Ashram is the supporter and protector of all other stages of life The Daksha Smriti declares the Grihastha Ashram as the root cause of the other three stages of life:त्रयाणामाश्रमाणां तु गृहस्थो योनिरुच्यते Just as all living beings are nurtured, supported, and sustained under the care of their mother, similarly, all religions, communities, and stages of life are dependent upon the Grihastha Ashram. As the foundation of all the stages of life is the Grihastha Ashram, the foundation of the Grihastha Ashram is the wife.   न गृहं  गृहमित्याहुर्गृहिणी गृहमुच्यते गृहस्थः| स तु विज्ञेयो गृहे यस्य पतिव्रता || A household is called a home because of the presence of a housewife. A man becomes a true householder when he has a devoted wife at home. Marriage is a sacred bond between the bride and groom, solemnized in the presence of fire and deities. On the surface, it may appear as a worldly celebration, but from a spiritual perspective, it is a process grounded in Vedic principles that establishes all moral values. Through procreation, it leads to the fulfillment of Pitru Rin (ancestral debt), along with a disciplined lifestyle, virtuous conduct, hospitality to guests, and service to all living beings. These pave the way for self-realization and spiritual liberation. The primary aim of the Vivah Sanskar is to dissolve worldly attachments and to impart knowledge of spiritual and social responsibilities. The Grihastha Dharma holds great significance in establishing the four goals of human life (Purusharth Chatushtaya)—Dharma (righteousness), Artha (wealth), Kama (desires), and Moksha (liberation). This sacrament's main purpose is to regulate and discipline the conduct of both men and women. A wife is the husband's Ardhangini (better half), and a husband is the wife's other half. Only after marriage do both achieve completeness.With proper and clear Vedic chants, the Vivah Sanskar influences the mind, intellect, and emotions, fostering mutual love between the couple. By adhering to the Grihastha Dharma as prescribed in the scriptures, one can overcome the three debts—Deva Rin (debt to gods), Pitru Rin (debt to ancestors), and Rishi Rin (debt to sages). The principles of Pativrata (devotion of the wife) and Eka Patnivrat (monogamy of the husband) are unique contributions of Indian sages and scriptures. The Indian marriage tradition also acknowledges the connection of past and future lives (a bond of seven lifetimes). In the Indian Vivah Sanskar system, the concept of divorce is unimaginable. If the thought of separation arises, it is certain that the sacrament was not performed according to the Vedic principles. In a proper Vedic sacrament, the question of separation does not arise. In the Indian tradition, the wife follows the vow of Pativrata Dharma, and the husband upholds the vow of Eka Patnivrat. This mutual commitment leads to deepening love and respect for each other. After marriage, the bride becomes a wife, and the groom becomes a husband. Through the marriage sacrament, both attain the eligibility to perform yajnas (sacrificial rituals) and practice righteous living.",
